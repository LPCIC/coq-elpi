(** Closing a term with holes with binders *)

(*

The operation consists in replacing all occurrences of the same hole
in a term by a bound variable.

We first traverse the term and count how many distinct hole are there
and replace them by a placeholder to be later abstracted.
Once we know how many binders we need, we generate the spine of binders
and replace the placeholders by the bound variables.

This example is interesting because it uses the constraint store
to attach data to holes, in particular if the hole has been seen before,
and to attach to each hole a unique number.
