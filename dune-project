 (description
  "Coq-elpi provides a Coq plugin that embeds ELPI. It also provides \
   a way to embed Coq's terms into λProlog using the Higher-Order \
   Abstract Syntax approach and a way to read terms back. In addition \
   to that it exports to ELPI a set of Coq's primitives, e.g. printing \
   a message, accessing the environment of theorems and data types, \
   defining a new constant and so on. For convenience it also provides \
   a quotation and anti-quotation for Coq's syntax in λProlog. E.g., \
   `{{nat}}` is expanded to the type name of natural numbers, or \
   `{{A -> B}}` to the representation of a product by unfolding the \
   `->` notation. Finally it provides a way to define new vernacular \
   commands and new tactics.")
