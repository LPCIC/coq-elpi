% constants: inductive types, inductive constructors, definitions
type global gref -> term. 

% binders: to form functions, arities and local definitions
type fun  @name -> term -> (term -> term) -> term.         % fun x : t =>

% Notes about (match Scrutinee TypingFunction Branches) when
%   Inductive i A : A -> nat -> Type := K : forall a : A, i A a 0
% and
%   Scrutinee be a term of type (i bool true 7)
% 
% - TypingFunction has a very rigid shape that depends on i. Namely
%   as many lambdas as indexes plus one lambda for the inductive itself
%   where the value of the parameters are taken from the type of the scrutinee:
%     fun `a` (indt "bool") a\
%      fun `n` (indt "nat) n\
%       fun `i` (app[indt "i", indt "bool", a n) i\ ..
%   Such spine of fun cannot be omitted; else elpi cannot read the term back.
%   See also bind-ind-arity in coq-lib.elpi, that builds such spine for you,
%   or the higher level api build-match (same file) that also takes
%   care of breanches.
% - Branches is a list of terms, the order is the canonical one (the order
%   of the constructors as they were declared). If the constructor has arguments
%   (excluding the parameters) then the corresponding term shall be a Coq
%   function. In this case

%
% {x1 x2} : decl x1 `x` <t>, def x2 `y` x1 <v> Vn ?- evar (Ev x1 x2) (<p> x1 x2)
%   
% When the program is over, a remaining syntactic constraint like the one above
% are read back and transformed into the corresponding evar_info.
%
% The client may want to provide an alternative implementation of
% declare-evar that, for example, typechecks the term assigned to Ev
% (engine/elaborator.elpi does it).

% When a goal (evar _ _ _) is turned into a constraint the context is filtered

% The invocation of a tactic with arguments: 3 x "y" (h x)
% on a goal named "?Goal2" with a sequent like
%
% x : t
% y := v : x
% ----------
% g x y
%
% is coded as an elpi goal
% 
% (pi x1\ decl x1 `x` <t> =>
%   pi x2\ def x2 `y` x1 <v> Vn =>
%    declare-evar
%       [decl x1 `x` <t>, def x2 `y` x1 <v> Vn]
%       (Evar x1 x2) (<g> x1 x2)),
% (pi x1\ pi x2\
%   solve

%        (Evar x1 x2) (<g> x1 x2)
%        [goal-name `?Goal2`]]
%     NewGoals
%
% If the goal sequent contains other evars, then a tactic invocation is
% an elpi query made of the conjunction of all the declare-evar queries
% corresponding to these evars and the query corresponding to the goal
% sequent. NewGoals can be assigned to a list of goals that should be
% declared as open. Omitted goals are shelved. If NewGoals is not
% assigned, then all unresolved evars become new goals, but the order
% of such goals is not specified.
%
% Note that the solve goal is not under a context containg the decl/def
% entries.  It is up to the user to eventually load the context as follows
%  solve _ [goal Ctx _ Ty] _ :- Ctx => unwind {whd Ty []} WhdTy.
%
% Finally the goal above can be represented as a closed term as
% (nabla x1\ nabla x2\
%      goal
%        [decl x1 `x` <t>, def x2 `y` x1 <v> Vn]
%        (Evar x1 x2) (<g> x1 x2)
%        [goal-name `?Goal2`])

%
% Remark that the uniform parameters do not have to be passed to t, since
% they never change, while non-uniform parameters have to be both abstracted
% in each constructor type and passed as arguments to t. Inside the declaration
% the type of t is the one given just before t\ (while in Coq the implicit
% argument status can change what one is supposed to pass to t).
% Finally the coq.elaborate-indt-decl can be used to fill in implicit arguments
% an infer universe constraints in the declaration above (the quotation adds
% an implicit argument for the type of y and for the argument to eq).
